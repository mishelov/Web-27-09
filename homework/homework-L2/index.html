      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>GitHub</strong>, is an Internet hosting service for software
        development and version control using <strong>Git</strong> . It provides
        the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug
        tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous
        integration, and wikis for every project.Headquartered in California, it
        has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.
      </p>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Development of the GitHub.com platform began on October 19, 2007.The
        site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath,
        P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been made available for a few
        months prior as a beta release. GitHub has an annual keynote called
        GitHub Universe.
      </p>
      <h3>Education Program</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>GitHub</strong> launched a new program called the GitHub Student
        Developer Pack to give students over the age of 13 free access to
        popular development tools and services. GitHub partnered with
        <em
          >Bitnami, Crowdflower, DigitalOcean, DNSimple, HackHands, Namecheap,
          Orchestrate, Screenhero, SendGrid, Stripe, Travis CI</em
        >
        , and <em>Unreal Engine</em> to launch the program.

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>freeCodeCamp</strong>(also referred to as Free Code Camp) is a
        non-profit organization that consists of an interactive learning web
        platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, online publications and
        local organizations that intend to make learning web development
        accessible to anyone. Beginning with tutorials that introduce students
        to <em>HTML, CSS</em> and <em>JavaScript</em>, students progress to
        project assignments that they complete either alone or in pairs. Upon
        completion of all project tasks, students are partnered with other
        nonprofits to build web applications, giving the students practical
        development experience.
      </p>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>freeCodeCamp</strong> was launched in October 2014 and
        incorporated as Free Code Camp, Inc. The founder, Quincy Larson, is a
        software developer who took up programming after graduate school and
        created freeCodeCamp as a way to streamline a student's progress from
        beginner to being job-ready.
      </p>
      <h3>Syllabus</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>self-paced</strong> curriculum involves 1,400 hours of
        interactive coding challenges and web development projects, plus 800
        hours of contributing to open-source projects for nonprofits and is
        constantly expanded by more challenges and projects.This translates into
        about one year of full-time coding. The curriculum is divided into
        <em>
          Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures,
          Front End Libraries, Data Visualization, APIs and Microservices, and
          Information Security and Quality Assurance</em
        >. Participants receive a certificate after completing each section.The
        curriculum emphasizes pair programming, intended to foster a culture of
        collaboration and shared learning, which can overcome a student's doubts
        about the adequacy of their skills (popularly referred to as “impostor
        syndrome”).The languages and technologies currently taught by
        freeCodeCamp include
        <em
          >HTML5, PHP, CSS 3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass, React.js,
          Node.js, Python, Express.js, MongoDB, and Git.</em

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Vue.js</strong> (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced "view")
        is an open-source model&#45;view&#45;viewmodel front end
        <em>JavaScript</em> framework for building user interfaces and
        single-page applications.It was created by <strong>Evan You</strong>,
        and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members.
        <br />
        <strong>Vue.js</strong> features an incrementally adaptable architecture
        that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. The
        core library is focused on the view layer only.Advanced features
        required for complex applications such as routing, state management and
        build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries
        and packages. Vue.js allows for extending <em>HTML</em> with
        <em>HTML</em> attributes called directives.The directives offer
        functionality to <em>HTML</em> applications, and come as either built-in
        or user defined directives.
      </p>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Vue</strong> was created by <em>Evan You</em> after working for
        <em>Google</em> using <em>AngularJS</em> in several projects. He later
        summed up his thought process: The first source code commit to the
        project was dated July 2013, and Vue was first released the following
        February, in 2014.

        <strong>Vue</strong> components extend basic <em>HTML</em> elements to
        encapsulate reusable code. At a high level, components are custom
        elements to which the Vue's compiler attaches behavior. In Vue, a
        component is essentially a Vue instance with pre-defined options.The
        code snippet below contains an example of a Vue component. The component
        presents a button and prints the number of times the button is clicked:

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Bootstrap</strong> is a free and open-source
        <em>CSS</em> framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end
        web development. It contains <em>HTML, CSS</em> and (optionally)
        <em>JavaScript</em>-based design templates for typography, forms,
        buttons, navigation, and other interface components. As of July 2022,
        <strong>Bootstrap</strong> is the eighth most starred project on
        <em>GitHub</em>, with over 158,000 stars.
      </p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, originally named
        <strong>Twitter Blueprint</strong>, was developed by
        <em>Mark Otto</em> and <em>Jacob Thornton</em> at
        <strong>Twitter</strong> as a framework to encourage consistency across
        internal tools. Before <strong>Bootstrap</strong> , various libraries
        were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a
        high maintenance burden. According to Otto: A super small group of
        developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool
        and saw an opportunity to do something more. Through that process, we
        saw ourselves build something much more substantial than another
        internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early version of
        <strong>Bootstrap</strong> as a way to document and share common design
        patterns and assets within the company.After a few months of development
        by a small group, many developers at <strong> Twitter</strong> began to
        contribute to the project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week
        for the <strong>Twitter</strong> development team. It was renamed from
        <strong>Twitter Blueprint</strong> to <strong>Bootstrap</strong> and
        released as an open-source project on August 19, 2011.It has continued
        to be maintained by <em>Otto, Thornton,</em> a small group of core
        developers, and a large community of contributors.
      </p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Bootstrap</strong> is an <em>HTML, CSS</em> &
        <em>JS Library</em> that focuses on simplifying the development of
        informative web pages (as opposed to web apps). The primary purpose of
        adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color,
        size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is
        whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking.
        Once added to a project, <strong>Bootstrap</strong> provides basic style
        definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance
        for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition,
        developers can take advantage of <em>CSS</em> classes defined in
        <strong>Bootstrap</strong> to further customize the appearance of their
        contents. For example,<strong> Bootstrap</strong>
        has provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more
        prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.
