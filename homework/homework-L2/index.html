      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>GitHub</strong>, is an Internet hosting service for software
        development and version control using <strong>Git</strong> . It provides
        the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug
        tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous
        integration, and wikis for every project.Headquartered in California, it
        has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.
      </p>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Development of the GitHub.com platform began on October 19, 2007.The
        site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath,
        P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been made available for a few
        months prior as a beta release. GitHub has an annual keynote called
        GitHub Universe.
      </p>
      <h3>Education Program</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>GitHub</strong> launched a new program called the GitHub Student
        Developer Pack to give students over the age of 13 free access to
        popular development tools and services. GitHub partnered with
        <em
          >Bitnami, Crowdflower, DigitalOcean, DNSimple, HackHands, Namecheap,
          Orchestrate, Screenhero, SendGrid, Stripe, Travis CI</em
        >
        , and <em>Unreal Engine</em> to launch the program.

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>freeCodeCamp</strong>(also referred to as Free Code Camp) is a
        non-profit organization that consists of an interactive learning web
        platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, online publications and
        local organizations that intend to make learning web development
        accessible to anyone. Beginning with tutorials that introduce students
        to <em>HTML, CSS</em> and <em>JavaScript</em>, students progress to
        project assignments that they complete either alone or in pairs. Upon
        completion of all project tasks, students are partnered with other
        nonprofits to build web applications, giving the students practical
        development experience.
      </p>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>freeCodeCamp</strong> was launched in October 2014 and
        incorporated as Free Code Camp, Inc. The founder, Quincy Larson, is a
        software developer who took up programming after graduate school and
        created freeCodeCamp as a way to streamline a student's progress from
        beginner to being job-ready.
      </p>
      <h3>Syllabus</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>self-paced</strong> curriculum involves 1,400 hours of
        interactive coding challenges and web development projects, plus 800
        hours of contributing to open-source projects for nonprofits and is
        constantly expanded by more challenges and projects.This translates into
        about one year of full-time coding. The curriculum is divided into
        <em>
          Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures,
          Front End Libraries, Data Visualization, APIs and Microservices, and
          Information Security and Quality Assurance</em
        >. Participants receive a certificate after completing each section.The
        curriculum emphasizes pair programming, intended to foster a culture of
        collaboration and shared learning, which can overcome a student's doubts
        about the adequacy of their skills (popularly referred to as “impostor
        syndrome”).The languages and technologies currently taught by
        freeCodeCamp include
        <em
          >HTML5, PHP, CSS 3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass, React.js,
          Node.js, Python, Express.js, MongoDB, and Git.</em

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Vue.js</strong> (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced "view")
        is an open-source model&#45;view&#45;viewmodel front end
        <em>JavaScript</em> framework for building user interfaces and
        single-page applications.It was created by Evan You, and is maintained
        by him and the rest of the active core team members. <br />
        <strong>Vue.js</strong> features an incrementally adaptable architecture
        that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. The
        core library is focused on the view layer only.Advanced features
        required for complex applications such as routing, state management and
        build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries
        and packages. Vue.js allows for extending <em>HTML</em> with
        <em>HTML</em> attributes called directives.The directives offer
        functionality to <em>HTML</em> applications, and come as either built-in
        or user defined directives.
      </p>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Vue</strong> was created by <em>Evan You</em> after working for
        Google using AngularJS in several projects. He later summed up his
        thought process: The first source code commit to the project was dated
        July 2013, and Vue was first released the following February, in 2014.

            liked about Angular and build something really lightweight."

      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Vue</strong> components extend basic <em>HTML</em> elements to encapsulate reusable code.
        At a high level, components are custom elements to which the Vue's
        compiler attaches behavior. In Vue, a component is essentially a Vue
        instance with pre-defined options.The code snippet below contains
        an example of a Vue component. The component presents a button and
        prints the number of times the button is clicked:
